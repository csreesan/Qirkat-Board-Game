Playing the game:
The game does not start until you press Game->Start. You can undo your move with
Game->Undo, and the board will undo the current player's previous move. To
put the board back to its initial position, press Game->New Game.

Making a Move:
In order to make a move, click on the piece. If the piece is allowed to be moved,
the piece will be shown to be selected in green and the possible moves will be shown.
Then the move is made if one of the possible moves is clicked. If the piece is not
allowed to be move, then it will be shown to be selected in red.

Setting Players:
White and black can be set to be either AI or Manual. To set white, go to White
dropdown menu, and to set black, go to Black dropdown menu.

Setting the Board:
You can set up the board which ever way you like by going to Game->Set Pieces
which will bring up another window. Pick the radio button for each square.
The squares are labeled with linearized index, starting at the bottom left
square. The bottom left is 0, and the top right is 24. At the bottom you can
pick who starts the game, and then press set, to set the game.
